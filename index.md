### CPSC 120

*Lab 1

Lab 1 is where I had the most fun because it was the first lab in our 
lesson where we got to experience computer science and pair programming.

* Lab 7

Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
Aces were dealt.

*Lab 5
	
Lab 5 is one of the labs i had the most fun because we got to Calculate 
the Area of a Rectangle, i had fun coding and learning how to code and make 
the numbers form the area of the rectangle.
